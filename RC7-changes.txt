Generic:
========

Profiling the code and using profile guided optimizations:
	The file 3dcolor.ps can be used for GS OTB training, as can the font catalogue.
	For the other benchmarks, the first dataset can be used for training.
	To create profile using gcc: make PGOINI=1
	To use profile info with gcc: make PGOUSE=1
The file extracttime.awk has been replaced with a perl version.
A new field (UID) has been added to the report.
	

Benchmark Specific
==================

GhostScript
	Using new version (8.54)
	Example files for gs8 are compiled into the init section using the built in ghostscript mechanism, as well as other configuration files.
		Configured with --enable-compile-inits
		Definition of which files to compile into the image can be found at gs8/src/int.mak under the macro EXAMPLE_FILES.
		gs8/src/unix-aux.mak holds the commands for generating the built in file system (mkromfs)
	Since we are not using jpeg2000, there is no reason to compile in that code. 
		Configured with --without-jasper --without-jbig2dec
	CMaps removed to reduce executable size since we are not using CIDFonts
	* With gcc executable is now under 6M, with MSVC8 under 5M.
	Sources were modified to avoid requirement to allow multiple definitions of symbols. 
	Sources were modified to fit within the EEMBC test harness.
	* GCC only, build is forced to -O0 due to fail when compiled with optimizations.
		* This is under investigation, though artifex claims may be gcc bug related to FP.
		* This is related to font construction.
	GS only flags are controlled by the variable GSOPTS in gcc.mak (moved from the iterations.mak file).
	Combination of which datasets to run, on which devices and with what flags is controlled by oav2/rungs.pl.


Selected devices and rational:
gs_bitcmyk_levels = 2 4 16 32 256 
	deskjet 
		Sample Inkjet printer handling (Final format to H-P DeskJet)
		* This is an HP official driver in GS8.54, it is somewhat buggy but works for the samples chosen
	laserjet 
		Sample Laser printer handling (Final format to H-P LaserJet)
		* This is an HP official driver in GS8.54, it is somewhat buggy but works for the samples chosen
	tiffg4 
		Fax like output (many printers today have MFP functionality), viewable monochrome
	bmp256 
		Viewable color (contone RGB format)
	bitcmyk
		RAW cmyk output halftoned at different color depths
		2/4/16/32 corresponding to 1/2/4/8 bits per color plane
		* This device can also go up to 12b and 16b color depth if we want to test them
		  May be good for future extension

New datafiles
	Previously used files
		doretree.ps - color vector graphics, default from GS samples , removed
		golfer.eps - BW vector graphics, default from GS samples , removed
		EEMBCJournalPage1.ps - bitmap image, 400K, removed
		Rotate-fontlist2.ps - all chars of one font, landscape orientation (2 lines of text), duplicated 10x - recommend remove or train
	New files 
		banner.ps - banner page, 
			* Processed 200 times via for loop
			* printed n-up (20x10) to a single output page to minimize output size
			* Testing text banner processing
		presentation.ps - 4 slides presentation x4 (collated copies), vertical gradient on first slide, 45deg lines on BG
			* Printed n-up (4x4) to a single output page to minimize output size
			* Testing processing for typical "easy" presentation
		presentation4.pdf - the same 4 slides, in pdf, 1 per page
			* Testing processing for typical "easy" presentation, pdf format, output performance as well.
			* sent 4 times to minimize startup penalty
		mandel.ps - color vector graphics, drawing a fractal
			* Testing computationaly intensive line drawing, scientific papers
		spreadsheet.ps - 2 pages of common spreadsheet material (numbers,text,charts)
			* Testing common spreadsheet printing
			* sent 8 times to minimize startup penalty
			* print n-up (4x4) to minimize output size
		photo.ps - 600DPI 8x6 with jpeg filter
			* sent 4 times to minimize startup penalty
			* print n-up (2x2) to minimize output size

	Training file
		3dcolor.ps - postscript colorspace mapping, color and vector graphics, using all devices.

	Potential new files
		fractal-fern.ps - monochrome vector graphics (computationaly intensive like mandel, but mono)
		ebreadme - readme for energybench, just text
		font catalogue - can be done for several fonts, already built in.
			Recommend instead of "rotate-fontlist" sample
			~140 pages

Notes:
	To produce output to separate pages for verification, supply the flag -split to rungs.pl 
	How to view bitcmyk output?
	Ghostscript supplies a utility script that can show cmyk files.
	Since this is RAW CMYK data, you need to know the image size (in pixels) to construct a viewable image,
	as well as the bit depth.
	For the benchmark images, install a default version of ghostscript that works on your host machine
	(e.g. from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1897&package_id=1845)
	Then invoke from oav2 directory
		<GS install dir>/bin/gswin32c.exe -dBITS=<N> -- gs8/lib/viewcmyk.ps <cmykfile>.cmyk<N>b 612
	e.g. 
		 /c/apps/gs/gs8.53/bin/gswin32c.exe -dBITS=2 -- gs8/lib/viewcmyk.ps gs-output/gs8.banner.cmyk2b 612

PSNR
	Fixed to take into account bits per sample for tiff
	Added PSNR for packed bits (cmyk 1/2/4/8)

Bezier
	The benchmark has been modified to save information from all interpolated points.
	In FP mode, it will also calculate SNR to determine pass/fail.
