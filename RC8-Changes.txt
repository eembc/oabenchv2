Generic:
========
	All benchmarks are now forced to a single image per algorithm.
	Execution of different datasets is done via a command line flag (-data<N>).

	Ghostscript build and run only enabled when OAFULL is defined on the make command line
	make TOOLCHAIN=gcc OAFULL=1

 Important: Several compilers including gcc on some platforms do not have a definition of the function hypot in math.h.
 If math.h does not have a definition for hypot, please define NEED_HYPOT=1 to get alternative definition from ghsotscript headers.

Benchmark Specific:
===================
	Ghostscript:
		. Fixed issues that resulted in failure when gcc was used with optimization
		. Fixed issues that affected RVDS-armcc and GreenHills-ppc compilers
		. Tested with doublecheck.
		. Not running deskjet and laserjet devices
		. Changed mandel run to output 300dpi
